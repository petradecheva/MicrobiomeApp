## Running locally (Step by step)
  
## Future ideas
  - Incorporating other input formats, such as BIOM 

## Input format:

  ###### Metadata file: 
  |  | sample_id | disease_stat | ... |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | 1. | Sample ID | Sample type | ... |
  
  ###### Subsample.shared(OTU) file: 
  | label | Group | numOTUs | Otu0001... | ... |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | Label | Sample type | OTU's sum | number of specific OTU | ... |
  
  ###### Taxonomy file: 
  | OTU | Size | Taxonomy | ... |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | OTU label | Number of sequences in the OTU| Consensus taxonomy | ... |
